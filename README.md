# 🏠 House Price Prediction - Linear Regression

This repository contains the implementation of Simple & Multiple Linear Regression using the Housing dataset as part of the AI & ML Internship Task 3.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement linear regression to predict house prices using multiple features and evaluate model performance.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **File Used**: `Housing.csv`
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## 🔍 Steps Covered

1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Handled categorical variables using binary mapping and one-hot encoding
3. Split data into training and test sets
4. Trained a `LinearRegression` model using Scikit-learn
5. Evaluated the model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
6. Plotted actual vs predicted house prices
7. Interpreted coefficients to understand feature impact
